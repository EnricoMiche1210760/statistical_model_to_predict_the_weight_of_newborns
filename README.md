# statistical_model_to_predict_the_weight_of_newborns

For this medical study, data collected from 3 hospitals, concerning 2500 newborns, were analysed.
In particular, the following variables were noted:
-age of the mother
-number of pregnancies sustained
-Smoking mother (0=NO, YES=1)
-Number of weeks of gestation
-Baby weight in grams
-Length in mm of the newborn
-Diameter of infant's skull in mm
-Type of delivery: Natural or Caesarean
-Hospital: 1, 2, 3
-Baby's sex: M or F
One wants to find out whether it is possible to predict the weight of the newborn at birth given all the other variables.
In particular, one wants to investigate a relationship with the mother's variables, to see whether or not they have
not have a significant effect, such as the potentially harmful effect of smoking (premature births
premature births?). The length and diameter of the infant's skull are also used because they can be estimated already
from ultrasound scans, but in general they could also serve as control variables).
